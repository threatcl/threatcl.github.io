title: Threatcl and CI/CD
---

One of the key goals of `threatcl` is to integrate into a version control system (VCS), source code management system (SCM), or into continuous integration/deployment system (CI/CD).

Mostly integrating into CI/CD is as simple as wrapping the docker version of `threatcl`.

If you're happy with using docker containers, cool:

```bash title="terminal"
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/threatcl/threatcl:latest
```

The following pages will go into various SCM platforms, to explain how to integrate `threatcl` into your code repos.
