The full Github Action documentation is available: https://github.com/threatcl/threatcl-action. 

This is also where you can see the current version of the action.

A good place to start is validate a folder of `threatcl` hcl files, as below:

<Code code={codeSnippet} lang="yaml" title=".github/workflows/validate.yml" />
