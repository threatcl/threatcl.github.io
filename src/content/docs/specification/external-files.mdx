title: External HCL Files
---

In both the [imports](/specification/threatmodel/#imports) and [including](/specification/threatmodel/#including) attributes you can refer to other files in a few ways.

## Local file reference

You can refer to a local file simply by providing the path to the file.

```hcl
including = "shared/city-threatmodel.hcl"
```

## Remote file reference

`threatcl` uses https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter for fetching files. This means that it can download natively over HTTPS, Git, Mercurial, S3 or GCP.

Sometimes `go-getter`'s protocol handling may need to be explicitly set. For instance:

```hcl
including = "git::http://github.com/threatcl/threatcl.git"
```

This will ensure that this gets handled via the Git protocol.

We've wrapped the function slightly to handle the use-case of downloading an entire git repo, and then selecting a single file. To do this, use the `|` separater.

```hcl
imports = ["github.com/threatcl/threatcl|examples/aws-security-checklist.hcl"]
```
