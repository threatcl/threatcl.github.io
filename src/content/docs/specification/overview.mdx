title: Threatcl Syntax Overview
---

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import minimumHcl from '/src/minimum.hcl?raw';

The syntax used by `threatcl` is built around Hashicorp's Configuration Language, or HCL. You can read more about HCL at [github.com/hashicorp/hcl](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl).

HCL's syntax is meant to be easy to read and write, and loosely feels closer like JSON.

## Arguments

An _argument_ assigns a value to an attribute. This is an example of a simple string assignment.

```hcl
description = "Description of something"
```

Most value types in `threatcl` are strings, but you may also encounter numbers and boolean values too. Numbers don't need `"` characters, but boolean can work either way. The following are all valid.

```hcl
internet_facing = true
new_initiative = "false"
risk_reduction = 50
```

String values can also accept multiline strings as well.

```hcl
description = <<EOT
This is a valid string.

And includes these lines too
EOT

next_val = "value"
```

Values in some circumstances may be a list or array of values as well.

```hcl
stride = ["Spoofing", "Info Disclosure"]
```

## Blocks

Blocks are used extensively by `threatcl`, and are used to contain other blocks and attributes.

Blocks will always have a type, and may optionally include a label or identifier. Here are some examples.

```hcl
usecase {
  description = "Description of the usecase"
}

information_asset "the name of the asset" {
  description = "A detailed description of the asset"
}

component "control" "control_name" {
  description = "A control"
}
```

In many circumstances you can have multiple blocks, but if there is a label or identifier, these should be unique.

## Comments

Just like HCL, we support the following comments syntax:

- `#` begins a single-line comment
- `//` also begins a single-line comment
- `/*` and `*/` are start and end delimiters for comments that span multiple lines.

## Variables

`threatcl` supports defining variables outside of your `threatmodel` blocks.

You can then use them for any attribute that accepts a string.

```hcl
variable "var_name" {
  value = "Variable text here"
}

threatmodel "tm" {
  author = "@xntrik"

  description = var.var_name
}
```

You can also interpolate variables into broader strings. For example

```hcl
description = "Some larger context ${var.var_name}"
```

This works in multi-line values as well.

```hcl
description = <EOT
A longer description.

And also include: ${var.var_name}
EOT
```

## Minimum requirements

The minimum requirements for a `.hcl` file to meet `threatcl`'s spec is to include a `spec_version` string, and at least one `threatmodel` block.

You need to give each `threatmodel` block a name.

The only required element inside each `threatmodel` is an `author` string.

This is a valid threat model file:

<Code code={minimumHcl} lang="hcl" title="minimum.hcl" />
