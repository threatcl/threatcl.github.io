import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import importedHcl from '/src/tower-of-london.hcl?raw';

The following is a lightweight example of a `threatcl` HCL file. The specification is built off HCLv2 - if you've ever written [terraform](https://www.terraform.io), this may seem familar to you. See [developer.hashicorp.com](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration) for more high level information about the syntax.

<Code code={importedHcl} lang="hcl" title="tower-of-london.hcl" />
